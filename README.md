# Maze-Solving-with-DFS

Problem:

Design the algorithm that finds the way from the start cell to the end cell on the given maze and write the program that shows the navigation in the form of animation on the screen. Show all the movements you made in the navigation (incorrect entry, return) and your instant score. Introduce a reasonable amount of wait time (like 100ms) to slow it down while showing the process steps. Show the result score when you reach the exit.
